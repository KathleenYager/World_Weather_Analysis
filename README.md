# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose:

The purpose of this analysis is to find a random range of cities with temperatures ranging from 75-90 degrees Fahrenheit to allow prospective vacationers to build a vacation itinerary. 

## Method:
The project uses API's for Open Weather and Google Maps to create a random selection of 2000 cities and collect inforamtion for each city, including:
 - city, 
 - country, 
 - latitude, 
 - longitude 
  - max temp. 
Based on the information collected, cities in the sample were narrowed to include only those within the selected temperature range. 

Google Maps was used to provide an interactive map with markers for each city that included hotel name, city, country, max temp and weather description. 

Below is a image of the map created.

## Summary:
API's provide analysts with robust information that can be used in a myriad of ways, including helping vacationers determine their next destination!
